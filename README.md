# CS370-Project

**Using Python3**

This project will look to acomplish two major goals:
1. Pull information from various websites
2. Use a monitor to display the information 

As for the final product, we would like to display weather condition, news stories, and top songs on Spotify on a monitor. 
Ideally, this monitor will be within a frame and behind a mirror. It should function as a mirror that has smart capabilities to display what the user wants.
As for the scope of the project we want to get the information displaying on a monitor and not worry about the assembly of the mirror apperatus.
This is becuase we do not want to take on more than we think we can handle and deliver on what we set out to create. 
We hope to continue this project after CS370 and get it into it's final form down the road

For task #1:
    We will be using beautifulsoup to scrape webpages using the network capability RPi4
    The information will consist of News, Weather and Music.
    Due to limited access of BS, we cannot log into individual users Spotify accounts so we will simply display the top songs of the day

For task #2:
    We will use any generic monitor in a vertical orientation to display the contenst we scape to the user
    We hope to utilize images to make for a cleaner user interface (image for current weather condition and cover art for top songs)
